# Hello

Some of the code that I would like to show recruiters is from my master degree courses, and due to that fact I have made them private to prevent other students from being able to search and pull my code. However, I have created a google drive with most of the code, please visit https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1qCazQsiJiEB6QF28Qe6_KMvBGxEB6Lmi?usp=sharing
Hopefully this slightly deeper layer should prevent unwanted access to the code, while not forcing recruiters to jump through to many hoops.

Thanks for your understanding,
Eric S
